### 🐞 Bug Reports

- Include a **clear title**, a concise description, and exact **file name/line number** if possible.
- Mention the expected vs actual behavior.
- Add **screenshots or screen recordings** if it helps.
- Provide **steps to reproduce**.

### 🌟 Feature Requests / Documentation Improvements

- If suggesting UI changes, include **mockups** or screenshots.
- If backend/API changes are involved, mention the endpoints and flow.

### 🧑‍💻 Workflow for Code Contributions
1. **Star** and **Fork** the repo.
2. Create a branch: `yourname/feature-name` or `yourname/bugfix-name`.
3. Make your changes following the project structure.
4. Run `npm run lint` to fix formatting.
5. **Test your code thoroughly**.
6. Commit using clear messages. Example:  
   `fix: corrected typo in LandingPage.jsx`  
   `feat: added baby sleep graph comparison`
7. Push to your fork and open a PR:
   - Reference the issue with: `Fixes #<issue-number>`
   - Keep PRs small and focused (1 issue per PR)

## 🧠 Code Style Guidelines

- **Use camelCase** for variables and function names.
- **Component files** should be PascalCase: `SleepTracker.jsx`
- Follow our ESLint + Prettier config (auto-fix with `npm run lint`).
- Keep functions modular and reusable.
- Write meaningful variable names, not `x`, `y`, or `temp123`.
